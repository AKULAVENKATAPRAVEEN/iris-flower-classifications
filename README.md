# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

A machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica** based on their **sepal** and **petal** length and width using multiple ML algorithms.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project uses the popular **Iris dataset** and applies various supervised learning algorithms to predict the species of a flower based on its measurements. It's a classic classification problem widely used for ML beginners.
